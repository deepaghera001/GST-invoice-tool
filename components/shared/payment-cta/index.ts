/**
 * Payment CTA Components
 * Modular, psychology-optimized payment call-to-action components
 * 
 * Design Philosophy:
 * - Delay download CTA until form completion (IKEA effect)
 * - Show progress while filling (endowment effect)
 * - Clear value proposition at completion (loss aversion)
 * - One strong CTA at bottom (completion bias)
